   <b>1.Transitional</b> <br>
   
    <i>The transitional interior design style is best described as updated classic (like this sophisticated office space by Katharine Pooley). It combines traditional elegance and character with contemporary updates in the form of accessories, cleaner lines and current textiles.
        Traditional features include the use of button-tufting, nailhead trim and existing architectural features such as fireplaces and cornicing.

        <b>2.Art Deco</b> <br>
        <i>
            Art Deco is an iconic early twentieth century interior design style of French origin which pervaded most of the decorative arts of the 1910s to the 1930s.

Key Art Deco indicators are stylised sunburst and graduated step motifs; a fascination with African, Russian and, most importantly, Egyptian cultures; and exotic materials such as macassar ebony and zebrano woods, lapis lazuli and jade stone and shagreen.

The style was heavily inspired by the Industrial Revolution so metal was also incorporated into luxury furniture design.

    <div class="box box3">
        <b>3.Chalet</b><br>
        <i>Recognised by its use of heavy timbers, animal hides and generously proportioned furniture, chalet style is the almost universal interior design style choice for mountain chalets and lakeside lodges.

            It suitably balances the natural characteristics of its locales by incorporating appropriate natural materials and colour palettes.
            Exposed beams, timber-clad walls and stone elements characterise the styles context. Typical chalet furniture often incorporates natural elements.</i>

    <div class="box box4">
        <b>4.Classical</b><br>
        <i>A classical interior style reference classical civilisations (predominantly Greek and Roman), antiquity and the classical tradition.

            This interior design style was popular during the Renaissance and then again in a revival form in the 18th and 19th centuries, the style is inherently sophisticated.
            
            Columns and other classical architectural elements are key in the styles interior and exterior architecture as well as furniture designs.
            
            The klismos chair, a bowed back open occasional chair with saber legs, is the most enduring classical furniture piece.</i>
